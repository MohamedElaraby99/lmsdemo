# Device Restriction System - Testing Guide

## 🧪 How to Test the Device Restriction System

### Prerequisites
1. Make sure both backend and frontend servers are running
2. Have at least one regular user account (role: USER) 
3. Have one admin account (role: ADMIN)
4. Access to multiple browsers or incognito windows

---

## 📱 Testing Scenarios

### **Scenario 1: First Device Registration**
**Goal**: Test that the first device gets registered successfully

**Steps**:
1. Open browser (Chrome) and go to `http://localhost:5173`
2. Login with a regular user account
3. **Expected Result**: 
   - User should login successfully
   - No device restriction message
   - Device gets registered in background

**Verification**:
- Login as admin → Go to `/admin/device-management`
- Find your user in the list
- Should show `1` active device

---

### **Scenario 2: Second Device Registration**
**Goal**: Test that the second device gets registered successfully

**Steps**:
1. Open a **different browser** (Firefox) or **incognito mode**
2. Go to `http://localhost:5173`
3. Login with the **same user account**
4. **Expected Result**: 
   - User should login successfully
   - Device gets registered
   - Now user has 2/2 devices

**Verification**:
- Check admin dashboard
- User should show `2` active devices
- Status should still be "طبيعي" (Normal)

---

### **Scenario 3: Device Limit Exceeded (Main Test)**
**Goal**: Test that the third device gets blocked

**Steps**:
1. Open a **third browser** (Safari) or **different incognito window**
2. Go to `http://localhost:5173`
3. Login with the **same user account**
4. **Expected Result**: 
   - User should see device restriction screen
   - Message: "جهاز غير مصرح - لقد تم الوصول للحد الأقصى من الأجهزة"
   - Cannot access the platform

**Verification**:
- User is completely blocked from accessing any content
- Only sees the device restriction page with contact admin button

---

### **Scenario 4: Admin Device Reset**
**Goal**: Test admin's ability to reset user devices

**Steps**:
1. Login as **admin** in any browser
2. Go to `/admin/device-management`
3. Find the test user in the list
4. Click the "إعادة تعيين" (Reset) button
5. Confirm the action
6. **Expected Result**: 
   - Success message appears
   - User's active devices count becomes `0`

**Verification**:
- User should now be able to login from the previously blocked device
- Device count resets and user can register devices again

---

### **Scenario 5: Individual Device Removal**
**Goal**: Test removing a specific device

**Steps**:
1. As admin, go to `/admin/device-management`
2. Click "عرض الأجهزة" (View Devices) for a user
3. In the modal, click the trash icon on one device
4. Confirm removal
5. **Expected Result**: 
   - Device becomes inactive
   - User count decreases by 1

---

## 🔧 Advanced Testing

### **Test Different Device Types**
1. **Desktop Browser**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
2. **Mobile Browser**: Open `http://YOUR_IP:5173` on phone
3. **Tablet Browser**: Use tablet or browser dev tools (F12 → responsive mode)

### **Test Device Fingerprint Changes**
1. Login from Chrome
2. Change browser zoom level significantly
3. Try to access again - should still work (same device)
4. Clear browser data and try again - might be treated as new device

### **Test Network Changes**
1. Login from home WiFi
2. Switch to mobile hotspot
3. Access again - should still work (IP change doesn't affect device fingerprint much)

## 🎯 Quick Testing Script

Here's a step-by-step quick test:

```bash
# Terminal 1 - Start Backend
cd lms-mern-project-main/backend
npm start

# Terminal 2 - Start Frontend  
cd lms-mern-project-main/client
npm run dev
```

### **5-Minute Test Sequence**:

1. **Chrome**: Login as user → ✅ Success (Device 1)
2. **Firefox**: Login as same user → ✅ Success (Device 2)  
3. **Safari/Incognito**: Login as same user → ❌ Blocked (Device 3)
4. **Admin Panel**: Reset user devices → ✅ Reset successful
5. **Safari**: Try login again → ✅ Success (Device 1 again)

## 🐛 Debugging & Monitoring

### **Check Backend Logs**
Monitor your backend console for:
```
=== DEVICE AUTHORIZATION CHECK ===
Checking device authorization for user: [USER_ID]
Device fingerprint: [FINGERPRINT_HASH]
Device authorized successfully
```

### **Check Frontend Console**
Open browser DevTools (F12) and look for:
- Device fingerprint generation logs
- API calls to `/device-management/register`
- Any error messages

### **Database Inspection**
If you have MongoDB access:
```javascript
// Check user devices
db.userdevices.find({user: ObjectId("USER_ID")})

// Check all active devices
db.userdevices.find({isActive: true})

// Count devices per user
db.userdevices.aggregate([
  {$group: {_id: "$user", count: {$sum: 1}}}
])
```

## 📊 Admin Dashboard Testing

### **Overview Tab Tests**:
1. Check if statistics show correct numbers
2. Verify platform stats (Mobile/Desktop/Tablet)
3. Check browser statistics
4. Look for users over limit count

### **Users Tab Tests**:
1. Search functionality - search by name/email
2. Filter by device status (all/over limit/under limit)
3. Pagination if you have many users
4. Last activity timestamps

### **User Devices Modal Tests**:
1. Click "عرض الأجهزة" on any user
2. Verify device information is displayed correctly
3. Test device removal
4. Check device status indicators

## ⚠️ Common Issues & Solutions

### **Issue 1**: Device not getting blocked
**Solution**: 
- Check if user role is "USER" (admins bypass device restrictions)
- Verify device fingerprint is generating differently
- Check backend logs for device registration

### **Issue 2**: Same browser treated as different device
**Solution**: 
- Clear browser cache/cookies
- Check if screen resolution changed
- Verify timezone settings

### **Issue 3**: Admin dashboard not showing devices
**Solution**: 
- Verify admin role in localStorage or Redux state
- Check API endpoints are working
- Look for CORS issues in network tab

### **Issue 4**: Device fingerprint too similar
**Solution**: 
- Use significantly different browsers
- Test from different operating systems
- Use mobile vs desktop

## 📱 Mobile Testing

### **Test on Real Mobile Device**:
1. Find your computer's IP address
2. Make sure mobile is on same network
3. Go to `http://YOUR_IP:5173` on mobile browser
4. Login and test device restrictions

### **Simulate Mobile in Browser**:
1. Open Chrome DevTools (F12)
2. Click device toggle icon
3. Select different device types
4. Test login from each "device"

## ✅ Expected Test Results Summary

| Test Scenario | Expected Result |
|---------------|-----------------|
| First device login | ✅ Success + Device registered |
| Second device login | ✅ Success + 2/2 devices |
| Third device login | ❌ Blocked with error message |
| Admin reset devices | ✅ Device count becomes 0 |
| Login after reset | ✅ Success + Device re-registered |
| Admin view devices | ✅ Shows device details |
| Remove specific device | ✅ Device becomes inactive |

## 🚀 Production Testing Notes

When testing in production:
1. Use test accounts, not real user accounts
2. Be careful with device resets - affects real users
3. Monitor server performance with device checking
4. Test with real mobile devices and different networks
